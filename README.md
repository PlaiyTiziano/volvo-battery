# Volvo-battery

As Volvo's iOS application does not send notifications when your car is almost
done charging, I've tried to build my own solution.

## Prerequisites

- The vin number of a volvo car that is supported by Volvo's developer API.
- Access to Volvo's developer platform.
- A published application on Volvo so you have a client id and secret.
- Ruby

## Setup

1. Clone this project.
1. Run bundle to install the dependencies.
1. Copy `.env.example` to an `.env` file
1. Enter your values in the .env file
